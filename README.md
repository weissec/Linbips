# Linbips.py
     
## Description:
This python script can be used to discover a list of employees and their role in a given organisation.
The script can also be used to scrape a list of potential usernames in different formats given a target Company name (-u option).

Why?
------------------------
Retrieving a list of employees and their role in an organistation might be useful during an OSINT phase for Red Teaming, Phishing, etc.
Alternatively a list of potential usernames is mostly useful for Password Spray attacks.
For example, in an Active Directory environment the generated list can be fired against a Domain Controller using the Metasploit "smb_login" module, with a weak password such as "Pasword123!".
